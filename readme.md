# The ultimate series collection by Eden

**Here is my top series database!** 😁

It's a website/database inspired by IMDB with some series, that you can filter by category. The website is entirely rendered with a server created with Node.js / Express, and is using the template generator EJS to render every page. 

## How to run it

Install node modules :

``` npm install ```

And run the server : 

``` node index.js ```

Visit your *localhost:3000*

## Built with

- Html, pure-CSS (frontend)
- Node.js, [Express](https://expressjs.com/fr/), [EJS](https://ejs.co/) (backend)
